## Equality ##
# To check if two Python values, or variables, are equal you can use ==. To check for inequality, you need !=. As a refresher, have a look at the following examples that all result in True. Feel free to try them out in the IPython Shell.

2 == (1 + 1)
"intermediate" != "python"
True != False
"Python" != "python"

# When you write these comparisons in a script, you will need to wrap a print() function around them to see the output.

## Instructions ##

# In the editor on the right, write code to see if True equals False.
# Write Python code to check if -5 * 15 is not equal to 75.
# Ask Python whether the strings "pyscript" and "PyScript" are equal.
# What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if True and 1 are equal.

# Comparison of booleans
print(True == False)

# Comparison of integers
print((-5 * 15) != 75)

# Comparison of strings
print("pyscript" == "PyScript")

# Compare a boolean with an integer
print(True == 1)

## Greater and less than ##

# In the video, Hugo also talked about the less than and greater than signs, < and > in Python. You can combine them with an equals sign: <= and >=. Pay attention: <= is valid syntax, but =< is not.

# All Python expressions in the following code chunk evaluate to True:

3 < 4
3 <= 4
"alpha" <= "beta"

# Remember that for string comparison, Python determines the relationship based on alphabetical order.

## Instructions ##

# Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
# x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined for you.
# "test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been defined for you.
# True is greater than False.

# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print(x >= -10)

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print('teste' <= y)

# Comparison of booleans
True > False

## Compare arrays ##

# Out of the box, you can also use comparison operators with Numpy arrays.

# Remember areas, the list of area measurements for different rooms in your house from Introduction to Python? This time there's two Numpy arrays: my_house and your_house. They both contain the areas for the kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom in the same order, so you can compare them.

## Instructions ##

# Using comparison operators, generate boolean arrays that answer the following questions:

# Which areas in my_house are greater than or equal to 18?
# You can also compare two Numpy arrays element-wise. Which areas in my_house are smaller than the ones in your_house?
# Make sure to wrap both commands in a print() statement so that you can inspect the output!

# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than or equal to 18
print(my_house >= 18)

# my_house less than your_house
print(my_house < your_house)

## and, or, not (1) ##

# A boolean is either 1 or 0, True or False. With boolean operators such as and, or and not, you can combine these booleans to perform more advanced queries on your data.

# In the sample code on the right, two variables are defined: my_kitchen and your_kitchen, representing areas.

# Instructions

# Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
# my_kitchen is bigger than 10 and smaller than 18.
# my_kitchen is smaller than 14 or bigger than 17.
# double the area of my_kitchen is smaller than triple the area of your_kitchen.

# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print(my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen < 18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print(my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print(2*my_kitchen < 3*your_kitchen)

## Boolean operators with Numpy ##

# Before, the operational operators like < and >= worked with Numpy arrays out of the box. Unfortunately, this is not true for the boolean operators and, or, and not.

# To use these operators with Numpy, you will need np.logical_and(), np.logical_or() and np.logical_not(). Here's an example on the my_house and your_house arrays from before to give you an idea:

np.logical_and(my_house > 13, 
               your_house < 15)

## Instructions ##

# Generate boolean arrays that answer the following questions:
# Which areas in my_house are greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10?
# Which areas are smaller than 11 in both my_house and your_house? Make sure to wrap both commands in print() statement, so that you can inspect the output.

# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10
print(np.logical_or(my_house > 18.5,my_house < 10))

# Both my_house and your_house smaller than 11
print(np.logical_and(my_house < 11,your_house < 11))

## if ##

# It's time to take a closer look around in your house.

# Two variables are defined in the sample code: room, a string that tells you which room of the house we're looking at, and area, the area of that room.

## Instructions ##

# Examine the if statement that prints out "Looking around in the kitchen." if room equals "kit".
# Write another if statement that prints out "big place!" if area is greater than 15.

# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
	
## Add else ##

# On the right, the if construct for room has been extended with an else statement so that "looking around elsewhere." is printed if the condition room == "kit" evaluates to False.

# Can you do a similar thing to add more functionality to the if construct for area?

## Instructions ##

# Add an else statement to the second control structure so that "pretty small." is printed out if area > 15 evaluates to False.

# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else:
    print("pretty small.")

## Customize further: elif ##

# It's also possible to have a look around in the bedroom. The sample code contains an elif part that checks if room equals "bed". In that case, "looking around in the bedroom." is printed out.

# It's up to you now! Make a similar addition to the second control structure to further customize the messages for different values of area.

## Instructions ##

# Add an elif to the second control structure such that "medium size, nice!" is printed out if area is greater than 10.

# Define variables
room = "bed"
area = 14.0

# if-elif-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
elif room == "bed":
    print("looking around in the bedroom.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-elif-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
elif area > 10:
    print("medium size, nice!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
	
## Driving right (1) ##

# Remember that cars dataset, containing the cars per 1000 people (cars_per_cap) and whether people drive right (drives_right) for different countries (country)? The code that imports this data in CSV format into Python as a DataFrame is available on the right.

# In the video, you saw a step-by-step approach to filter observations from a DataFrame based on boolean arrays. Let's start simple and try to find all observations in cars where drives_right is True.

# drives_right is a boolean column, so you'll have to extract it as a Series and then use this boolean Series to select observations from cars.

## Instructions ##

# Extract the drives_right column as a Pandas Series and store it as dr.
# Use dr, a boolean Series, to subset the cars DataFrame. Store the resulting selection in sel.
# Print sel, and assert that drives_right is True for all observations.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars["drives_right"]

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)

## Driving right (2) ##

# The code in the previous example worked fine, but you actually unnecessarily created a new variable dr. You can achieve the same result without this intermediate variable. Put the code that computes dr straight into the square brackets that select observations from cars.

## Instructions ##

# Convert the code on the right to a one-liner that calculates the variable sel as before.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
sel = cars[cars["drives_right"]]

# Print sel
print(sel)

## Cars per capita (1) ##

# Let's stick to the cars data some more. This time you want to find out which countries have a high cars per capita figure. In other words, in which countries do many people have a car, or maybe multiple cars.

# Similar to the previous example, you'll want to build up a boolean Series, that you can then use to subset the cars DataFrame to select certain observations. If you want to do this in a one-liner, that's perfectly fine!

## Instructions ##

# Select the cars_per_cap column from cars as a Pandas Series and store it as cpc.
# Use cpc in combination with a comparison operator and 500. You want to end up with a boolean Series that's True if the corresponding country has a cars_per_cap of more than 500 and False otherwise. Store this boolean Series as many_cars.
# Use many_cars to subset cars, similar to what you did before. Store the result as car_maniac.
# Print out car_maniac to see if you got it right.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
car_maniac = cars[cars["cars_per_cap"] > 500]

# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)	

## Cars per capita (2) ##

# Remember about np.logical_and(), np.logical_or() and np.logical_not(), the Numpy variants of the and, or and not operators? You can also use them on Pandas Series to do more advanced filtering operations.

# Take this example that selects the observations that have a cars_per_cap between 10 and 80. Try out these lines of code step by step to see what's happening.

cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 10, cpc < 80)
medium = cars[between]

## Instructions ##

# Use the code sample above to create a DataFrame medium, that includes all the observations of cars that have a cars_per_cap between 100 and 500.
Print out medium.

# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 100, cpc < 500)
medium = cars[between]

# Print medium
print(medium)
